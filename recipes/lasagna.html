    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a type of pasta made in very wide, flat sheets. It is a traditional 
      Italian dish that consists of stacked layers of pasta 
      alternating with fillings 
      such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, 
      cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices. The dish is typically 
      topped with grated cheese, which melts during baking. Lasagna 
      is usually served as a hot, oven-baked 
      dish and is cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><strong>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
      <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the 
      lasagna noodles and cook until al dente (firm) according to 
      package directions. Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet or Dutch oven, brown the beef, sausage, 
      onion, and garlic over medium-high heat until no pink remains. Drain any fat.</li>
      <li>Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon of salt, 
      and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper. Simmer uncovered over medium heat 
      for 5 minutes or until slightly thickened. Taste and season with 
      additional salt if desired.</li>
      <li>In a separate medium bowl, combine 1 ½ cups mozzarella cheese, 
      ¼ cup Parmesan cheese, ricotta, parsley, egg, and ¼ teaspoon salt.</li>
      <li>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9x13 pan or casserole dish. Top it with 
      3 lasagna noodles. Layer with ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup 
      of meat sauce. Repeat twice more. Finish with 3 noodles topped with remaining sauce.</li>
      <li>Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove the foil and sprinkle the top of the lasagna with the 
      remaining 2 ½ cups mozzarella cheese and ¼ cup Parmesan cheese. Bake 
      uncovered for an additional 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly. Broil 
      for 2-3 minutes if desired.</li>
      <li>Rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting.</li>
