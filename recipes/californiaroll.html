    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
    <p>
    A California roll is a type of sushi roll that originated in North America and is a variation of the traditional Japanese sushi rolls. It is made with sushi rice, 
    cucumber, imitation crab, and avocado, all wrapped in a sheet of nori (seaweed). The roll is often prepared 
    as an uramaki, with the rice on the outside and the nori on the inside, giving it a visually distinct appearance. Sometimes, the outer layer 
    of rice is sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds or roe, such as tobiko from flying fish, to enhance its flavor and appearance.

      <li>0.25 pound cooked crab meat</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise</li>
      <li>5 sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
      <li>1 avocado</li>
      <li>0.25 cup red caviar, such as tobiko</li>
      <li>1 English cucumber: (seeded and sliced into strips)</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><strong>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>Wrap a sushi rolling mat completely in plastic wrap and set aside.</li>
      <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce 
        heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid 
        has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer rice to a bowl and cut in 
        vinegar using a rice paddle or wooden spoon. Season with sugar 
        and salt. Allow to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Combine crab meat with mayonnaise in a small bowl.</li>
      <li>Place nori sheet on a flat work surface. Spread a thin layer 
        of rice on top of nori.</li>
      <li>Place nori, rice side down, on the prepared rolling mat. Place 
        2 to 3 avocado slices on top of the nori in one layer.</li>
      <li>Top with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the crab mixture.</li>
      <li>Spoon 1 to 2 teaspoons tobiko lengthwise on one side of the avocado-crab 
        mixture, and 2 cucumber strips on the other side.</li>
      <li>Using the mat as a guide, carefully roll the California roll 
        into a tight log. Remove the rolling mat. Top roll with more tobiko, cover 
        with plastic wrap, and gently press the tobiko into the top of the roll.</li>
      <li>Remove the plastic and cut into 6 even pieces using a wet knife. Repeat 
        with remaining sheets of nori and filling. Serve garnished with pickled 
        ginger, soy sauce, and wasabi paste.</li>
