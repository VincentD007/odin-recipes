    <h3><em>Description</em></h3>
    <p>
    A California roll is a type of sushi roll that originated in North America and is a variation of the traditional Japanese sushi rolls. It is made with sushi rice, 
    cucumber, imitation crab, and avocado, all wrapped in a sheet of nori (seaweed). The roll is often prepared 
    as an uramaki, with the rice on the outside and the nori on the inside, giving it a visually distinct appearance. Sometimes, the outer layer 
    of rice is sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds or roe, such as tobiko from flying fish, to enhance its flavor and appearance.
